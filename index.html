They provided me with essential tips and tricks no other people even on Youtube would show to you. I have paid for Coaching before on other websites but I must say I've learn more with Magic and his team then paying someone on an official website. The amazing community is one thing websites, like Proguides or Metafy have as Magic's Student all help one nd other out. The servers also overall relaxed and laid back attitude makes it a safe space for everyone to work together and reach their Dream rank. I myself have went from Silver 1 to Plat 2 ina mere month!! and it's s all due to Magic's ability to teach and help every student improve. "</p>

First he has me post my setup because it was almost instantly he realized it had like no space. Then after that he made me fix some settings. Then he  helped me with my sens and me not tensing up. Overall he is a really good coach and keeps you calm and collected. He gives clear instructions to help you. Also he did all this even though he just got home. He is also very nice and will help you in a short amount of time."</p>

Coach Magic really does help you get the rank you want and you cant find a better discord or service anywhere. So much respect for him and again would really recommend he is goated."</p>

                                <p>"Got coached by Keops yesterday, and it was an awesome expérience ! I didn't really knew what to expect from this kind of coaching, but Keops was really clear, explaining everything methodically in order for me to understand, adapting to the placer he's coaching, and he had the analysis to find what were the real issues in my gameplay, he knows his stuff :D If I had to do a constructive criticising, I would say that there was a lot of different i stuff to apply at the same time during the first game, so I was a bit overwhelmed, but there's no real solution when you have to do a coaching session within one or two our 10/10 !

                                <p>"Coach Mon had some really good advice in my first game and really gave me some good warmup tips. I will be able to properly warmup well and he also helped me select my gun to use between vandal and phantom (phantom). Coach Mon also gave me some good compliments because I was sort of down on myself about my KD but he complimented me for acknowledging my own mistakes on my own. Coach Magic told me some great advice, and one of them is that I will be playing Reyna for an entire week.  He acknowledged to me that I was a Reyna player and affirmed that I should use my phantom.  Coach Magic taught me some good binds for my abilities, and he said I will be able to actually talk to me in my future. He definitely taught me some important things and I am looking forward to improving and grinding hard! thumbsup"</p>

                                <p>"I got coached by Coach Markx today and he did a great job (VOD review). He did not only show the mistakes I did but made me find out myself what I did wrong and then explained why it was bad and how I could have avoided that or what I could have done instead. Over the lesson I was able to take many notes on things I have to improve on and I think if I keep focusing on the mistakes Markx explained to me today and try to fix them one by one, I can reach gold really fast. I watched multiple lessons already but I could never really tell wether I do the same mistakes or not and Coach Markx deffinitely helped me today to determine which mistakes in particular I tend to do and how to avoid doing them again. Deffinitely was worth the time!"</p>
